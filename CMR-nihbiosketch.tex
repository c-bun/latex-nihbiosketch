\section{Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}
Methods and tool development have characterized my academic career and continue
to inspire my future work. Throughout my undergraduate and graduate work I
enjoyed designing solutions to problems in both organic chemistry and chemical
biology. My undergraduate research involved development and study of new
transition-metal catalyzed reactions involving carbon--carbon bond activation.
Under the mentorship of professor Jeffrey Johnson, this work lead to some of the
first kinetic characterizations of C--C bond activation reactions. During the
summer of 2011 I had the opporunity to conduct research in Buenos Aires,
Argentina in the lab of... % TODO finish this
I continued similar work in organometallic catalysis during the first two years of my
graduate education in the lab of Professor Vy Dong. My work in the Dong Lab
sought efficient transformations for the synthesis of carbohydrates; a longstanding
problem in organic chemistry. Following advancement, I moved to the Prescher lab % QUESTION Address the move at some point?

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item My early publications directly addressed the fact that substance abuse is
    often overlooked in older adults. However, because many older adults were
    raised during an era of increased drug and alcohol use, there are reasons
    to believe that this will become an increasing issue as the population
    ages.   These publications found that older adults appear in a variety of
    primary care settings or seek mental health providers to deal with emerging
    addiction problems.  These publications document this emerging problem but
    guide primary care providers and geriatric mental health providers to
    recognize symptoms, assess the nature of the problem and apply the
    necessary interventions.   By providing evidence and simple clinical
    approaches, this body of work has changed the standards of care for
    addicted older adults and will continue to provide assistance in relevant
    medical settings well into the future.  I served as the primary
    investigator or co-investigator in all of these studies.

        PMC9000292

\end{enumerate}


\item In addition to the contributions described above, with a team of
    collaborators, I directly documented the effectiveness of various
    intervention models for older substance abusers and demonstrated the
    importance of social support networks.   These studies emphasized
    contextual factors in the etiology and maintenance of addictive disorders
    and the disruptive potential of networks in substance abuse treatment. This
    body of work also discusses the prevalence of alcohol, amphetamine, and
    opioid abuse in older adults and how networking approaches can be used to
    mitigate the effects of these disorders.

\end{enumerate}

\item Methadone maintenance has been used to treat narcotics addicts for many
    years but I led research that  has shown that over the long-term, those in
    methadone treatment view themselves negatively and they gradually begin to
    view treatment as an intrusion into normal life.   Elderly narcotics users
    were shown in carefully constructed ethnographic studies to be especially
    responsive to tailored social support networks that allow them to
    eventually reduce their maintenance doses and move into other forms of
    therapy.  These studies also demonstrate the policy and commercial
    implications associated with these findings.
